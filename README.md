# DH ATLAS REST API (v0.0.1) â€” RAMOSE Configuration

This repository contains the initial configuration for generating a REST API for the DH ATLAS project using [RAMOSE](https://github.com/opencitations/ramose).

---

## Description

DH ATLAS is a knowledge graph that maps international research on Italian digital cultural heritage. This REST API allows querying the graph via SPARQL endpoints, offering semantic and statistical operations over the data.

The configuration is defined in the `test.hf` file, compatible with RAMOSE.

---

## Repository v0.0.1 Contents

- `test.hf`: RAMOSE configuration file for the REST API.
- `README.md`: this file.
- `start.sh`: script to launch RAMOSE.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.

---

## Local Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dh-atlas/api.git
   cd dh-atlas-api
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install RAMOSE and dependencies: RAMOSE is available on PyPI. You can install it with:
   ```bash
   pip install ramose
   ```
If you want to install from source (e.g., for development), clone the RAMOSE repository and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/opencitations/ramose.git
cd ramose
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```
4. Run the API locally: From the root of your DH ATLAS API repository:
   ```bash
   ramose test.hf
   ```
5. Access the API documentation: Open your browser and go to:
   ```bash
   http://127.0.0.1:8081/api/v1
   ```
